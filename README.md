> A minimal quickstart template for a docs site

## Purpose

<!-- If you are forking this template, this section can be deleted -->

- Create a **new repo** using the template and host it on Github Pages immediately. This is good for trying out Docsify or building a site project scratch.
- Or use this as a  **base** - follow instructions to download just the necessary files to your existing report's docs directory
- View the **live** demo site.

For more info on Docsify, see my [DocsifyJS Tutorial]. That covers intro to DocsifyJS, including installation, running and configuration. If you look at the repo, that has has more content and configuration than this relatively plain template site.

## How to use Docsify in your projects 

<!-- If you are forking this template, this section can be deleted -->

Use one of the approaches below to setup Docsify in your own project.

### a. Use this template

Create a _new_ forked project based on this template  by clicking the button below. You'll get a fork in your own repo.

[![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Use_this_template-green.svg)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-js-template/generate)

You can then customize by following the _TODO_ items through the code.

You could start adding code outside of the _docs_ directory, however this project is intended as a standalone docs site which can be configured for experimentation and used as reference.

### b. Add Docsify to an existing project's docs directory

This will copy the contents of the docs directory from Github to the current folder - ideal if there is an existing project and you want to _Docsify_ it. The `curl` command should be installed first, or use `wget`.

1. Ensure you have `curl` command installed.
2. Navigate to your project's `docs` folder.
    ```sh
    cd my-project/docs
    ```
3. Download necessary files in the template [docs](/docs) directory to your project using this two-line command (copy the whole thing). The `-O` flag will save the file locally, keeping the original filename.
    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-js-template/master\
    /docs/\{_coverpage.md,_sidebar.md,.nojekyll,index.html,README.md\} -O
    ```


## Setup and run

### Remote use

Whatever approach you use to setup a _docs_ directory, you can use your own project or a forked template a site on Github Pages or Netlify.

There won't be any code to the site other than _docs_ site, but this is still fine as a standalone online demo of _Docsify_ that you can tweak.
